          Collaborated on the RTC to JIRA migration project under a senior developer, leading all scripting tasks,
          attending user meetings, and updating the utility in Node.js and TypeScript for seamless data.
          Developed automation scripts in Python and Golang, including a POC integrating Pocketbase,
          PostgreSQL, and Golang.
          Enhanced functionality and performance of GitLab metrics collector tool in Python, streamlining code
          quality insights.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an intern, I gained valuable experience working on real-world projects with industry-standard tools and practices. I deepened my understanding of Node.js and TypeScript through direct contributions to a live migration utility, while also learning how to manage requirements and expectations during client/user meetings. Additionally, I explored backend automation by writing Python and Golang scripts and experimenting with integrations using Pocketbase and PostgreSQL. I also became familiar with DevOps practices by improving the GitLab metrics collector, which taught me how data-driven tools can drive better code quality and team productivity.

        <p>
          During my time at Avrutti research, I worked on several prototypes of
          an e-commerce website, before finalizing one as the main website for
          hoysala electronics. For the prototypes, I worked as the team lead of
          a team of 4, 2 web developers and 2 android developers. These
          prototypes were in React with Strapi and React with Firebase before
          finalizing Next.js and Firebase for the final website, which I made by
          myself, under the guidance of a senior developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an Intern, I learnt a lot through this internship. I learnt all
          about Nextjs, how it works, and how pretty much the same jsx code can
          get drastically faster using different rendering options. I also
          gained a thorough understanding of tools such as Git & Github, Husky,
          Eslint, Prettier, Tailwind, etc and how they are configured in an
          industrial project.

          For the young startup "Mindinator", I worked with 3 other developers
          and a designer to ensure the project (Mindinator) was built as
          required. My responsibilities were to make sure the designs translated
          perfectly into code. I also developed a few of the games. The project
          was made in SvelteKit, with 0 external dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project provided exposure to tools used in the industry, such as
          Github for issue and project tracking. I also learnt non-technical
          skills, teamwork, leadership, accountability and pair programming.

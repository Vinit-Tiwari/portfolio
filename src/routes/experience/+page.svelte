        <p>
          During my time at Avrutti research, I worked on several prototypes of
          an e-commerce website, before finalizing one as the main website for
          hoysala electronics. For the prototypes, I worked as the team lead of
          a team of 4, 2 web developers and 2 android developers. These
          prototypes were in React with Strapi and React with Firebase before
          finalizing Next.js and Firebase for the final website, which I made by
          myself, under the guidance of a senior developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an Intern, I learnt a lot through this internship. I learnt all
          about Nextjs, how it works, and how pretty much the same jsx code can
          get drastically faster using different rendering options. I also
          gained a thorough understanding of tools such as Git & Github, Husky,
          Eslint, Prettier, Tailwind, etc and how they are configured in an
          industrial project.

        <p>
          For the young startup "Mindinator", I worked with 3 other developers
          and a designer to ensure the project (Mindinator) was built as
          required. My responsibilities were to make sure the designs translated
          perfectly into code. I also developed a few of the games. The project
          was made in SvelteKit, with 0 external dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project provided exposure to tools used in the industry, such as
          Github for issue and project tracking. I also learnt non-technical
          skills, teamwork, leadership, accountability and pair programming.
